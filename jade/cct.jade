      | The two wall displays, installed in the administration wing of the CCT building, communicate the focus upon creative and multi-disciplinary initiatives driving the department. In collaboration with computer programmer Derick Ostrenko, the CCT mission statement was recreated as a set of visuals and colors using Processing - an open source programming language. In addition to the wall displays, a signage system was implemented across the building's 4 floors.
