      | In a collaboration with faculty advisor Rod Parker, I designed promotional material for the Social Fabrics exhibition at the 2008 CAA conference in Dallas, TX. The promotional materials included a website, posters, trifold brochure, event banners and t-shirts. In addition, the exhibit was featured in the Intelligent Agent journal, for which I designed the cover sleeve.
