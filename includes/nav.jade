    | My work explores the relationship between the universality of myth and life as performance.
    | With influences as diverse as Rousseau and Andy Warhol, new variations are created from both explicit and implicit narratives.
    | Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the zeitgeist. What starts out as triumph soon becomes manipulated into a carnival of futility, leaving only a sense of unreality and the chance of a new reality.
    | As momentary phenomena become clarified through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with a glimpse of the undefined of our world.
